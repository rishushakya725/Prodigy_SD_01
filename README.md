Temperature Conversion Program
Overview
This project is a simple Temperature Conversion Program written in Python. It allows users to input a temperature value and the unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and then it converts the value to the other two units.

Features
Converts temperatures between:
Celsius (°C) Fahrenheit (°F) Kelvin (K) Provides accurate results with up to two decimal places. Handles invalid input values gracefully by alerting the user.

How It Works
When the program is run, it prompts the user to:

Enter a temperature value. Specify the unit of the temperature (C, F, or K). The program then converts the entered temperature to the other two units and displays the results.
